# manatal-api-test

I chose to work with docker to facilitate the deployment on my server.

* docker-compose.yml 
  There is one container for django and another one for postgres

* Dockerfile
  This file setup the environment when deploying the stack and install requirements.txt file

* requirements.txt
  This file contains the python dependencies needed for the project


Time spent: 6hours for the whole solution and 30minutes to deploy it on my server with domain+SSL
